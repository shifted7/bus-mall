This project allows a user to view three random products from a list, and choose one of those products by clicking on its image. The user can do this for a set number of rounds, at which point they receive a chart and data summarizing their choices that counts how many times each product was seen and how often it was chosen. The user can refresh or reset the page to continue to answer questions, and their previous choices will be saved locally and included in their next results.

The three images are chosen such that none of the three are duplicates, nor have been shown in the last two rounds.

This project shows the development of my learning. It demonstrates the functionality of events (via event listeners), charts (via chart.js), data persistence (via localStorage), and css transitions.
